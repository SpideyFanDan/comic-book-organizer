### MVP User Stories

_**MVP User stories**_

- As a collector, I want to filter the search by title and issue number to narrow down the search.
- As a collector, I want to be able to click on one comic book listing and see the expanded information about that comic including the picture of the cover.
- As a collector, I would like to be able to navigate to the other pages from a navigation bar in the header.
